## Neurolib

### A machine learning library for neuroscientists

## Requirements

The code is written in Python 3.5. You will need the bleeding edge versions of the following packages:

- tensorflow
- bidict
- seaborn

In addition, up-to-date versions of numpy, scipy and matplotlib are expected.

## Usage

This library is at the moment in an alpha stage. It is recommended to use this code starting from the tests folder. As usual, to run any specific test, first add the root directory of neurolib to your PYTHONPATH:

$ export PYTHONPATH=path_to_neurolib:PYTHONPATH

Please report bugs.
