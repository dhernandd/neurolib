### The following models are currently implemented:

- fLDS (arXiv:1511.07367)
- VIND (arXiv:1811.02459)

A good place to start are the tutorials at https://github.com/dhernandd/neurolib/tree/master/neurolib/tutorials

Soon to be released:

- Generic RNN-based models

In the pipeline

- HMMs
- Switching LDS

## Requirements

The code is written in Python 3.5. You will need the bleeding edge versions of the following packages:

- tensorflow
- bidict
- seaborn

In addition, up-to-date versions of numpy, scipy and matplotlib are expected.
